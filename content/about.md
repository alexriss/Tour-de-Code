This blog is intended to present bite-sized code snippets to outline algorithmic ideas and technical implementation details.

I am interested in scientific computing, machine learning, computational photography and arts, as well as many other topics. Currently, I am diving into [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

If you have any contributions, questions, suggestions or criticism, do not hesitate to contact me!

Peace!
